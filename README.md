**Roboflow** makes managing, preprocessing, augmenting, and versioning datasets for computer vision seamless. This is
the official Roboflow python package that interfaces with the [Roboflow API](https://docs.roboflow.com). Key features of
Roboflow:

## Installating Roboflow

To install this package, please use `Python 3.6` or higher. We provide three different ways to install the Roboflow
package to use within your own projects.

Install from PyPi (Recommended):

```bash
pip install roboflow
```

# RTSP streaming using GStreamer

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113200203/210094301-7906bf10-205f-4980-85b2-111752dbdbdf.mp4

Python implementation to stream camera feed from OpenCV videoCapture via RTSP server using GStreamer 1.0.

## Installating Gstreamer and RTSP Application

This implementation has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. So the installation steps are specific to debian based linux distros.

### Step-1 Install GStreamer-1.0 and related plugins
    
    sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-doc gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-gtk3 gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio
    
### Step-2 Install RTSP server
    
    sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-rtsp
    
### Step-3 Install OpenCV2
    
    pip install opencv-python
    
### Requirement
- Python 3.6+
- Linux Based OS (Ubuntu 20.04 - Tested)

### Usage
> Run stream.py with required arguments to start the rtsp server

##### Sample 
    
    python stream.py --device_id "rtsp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mp4" --fps 24 --image_width 240 --image_height 160 --port 8554
    
### Visualization

You can view the video feed on `rtsp://server-ip-address:8554/stream_uri`

e.g: `rtsp://192.168.1.12:8554/video_stream`

You can either use any video player which supports rtsp streaming like VLC player or you can use the `open-rtsp.py` script to view the video feed.
